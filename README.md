# Video-Games-DB

An Angular application for browsing video games using the RAWG Video Games Database API.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.2.2.

## Setup

### 1. Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Set up environment variables
1. Copy `src/environments/environment.template.ts` to `src/environments/environment.ts`
2. Copy `src/environments/environment.prod.template.ts` to `src/environments/environment.prod.ts`
3. Replace the placeholder values with your actual API keys:
   - `YOUR_RAPIDAPI_KEY_HERE` - Get from [RapidAPI](https://rapidapi.com/)
   - `YOUR_RAWG_API_KEY_HERE` - Get from [RAWG Video Games Database](https://rawg.io/apidocs)

### 3. Start the development server
```bash
npm start
```
Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
